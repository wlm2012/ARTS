Let  me tell you a little about myself.
I was born and raised in Minnesota and I'm a native of the city of Saint Paul.
I grew up there with my parents and my eight brothers and two sisters. 
I'm the eleventh child ,so you could say I'm the baby of family,but I swear I wasn't spoiled.
That's right ,I'm part of a big family, probably the biggest family in the neighborhood.
