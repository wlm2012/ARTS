This episode is a story about me, introducing vocubulary you need to talk about yourself.

Let's get started.

Let me tell you a little about myself.

I was born and raised in Minnesota and I'm a native of the city of Saint Paul. 

I grew up there with my parents and my eight brothers and two sisters.

I'm the eleventh child, so you could say I'm the baby of the family,

but I swear I wasn't spoiled.

That's right, I'm part of a big family, probably the biggest family in the neighborhood,

perhaps the biggest family in the state!

I had a happy childhood, for the most part.

My father and mother didn't have a lot of money,

but because they both worked hard, we never felt deprived.

I wasn't much interested in sports, like my brothers were.
