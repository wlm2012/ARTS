 This is an introduction to our lessons on ELSPod.com. If you understand how these lessons are put together-how we make them and why we make them- you'll be able to take full advantage of them ,or to get the most out of them.  
 
 The best way for me to help you  improve your English faster is by explaining how and why you should use our Learning Guides.
 
 I want to tell you first some, what I'm going to call "secrets" that may surprise you about learning languages , and then I'm going to explain how those secrets relate to using  our guides.
 
To understand how to use ESLPod lessons the most effective way. 

You have to understand at least one big thing about language learning ,and once you understand this big thing, you'll understand the rest what I'm going to  tell you about our Learning Guides.

Okay,so here's the one big important idea .

To pick up - or to , what we would  say "acquire" - a language, to really know a language, you have to understand the language.

To pick up a language,all you really need to do is understand the language you are listening to or reading.

If you can't understand it ,you can't learn it - or we would say,you can't "acquire" it.

Now ,You may be thinking to youself ,"well, that's obvious, Jeff.Of course, you can't acquire a language unless you understand it.

But it isn't really obvious at all.

In fact, I think that for many people, they spend their whole lives not understanding this basic idea.

Many people spend years trying to improve their English, and they do all sorts of things.

They study grammar ,they memorize vocabulary, they make lists, 
they make flsh cards - little pieces of parper to try to memorize a word,they repead  they take tests,
