 This is an introduction to our lessons on ELSPod.com. If you understand how these lessons are put together-how we make them and why we make them- you'll be able to take full advantage of them ,or to get the most out of them.  
 
 The best way for me to help you  improve your English faster is by explaining how and why you should use our Learning Guides.
 
 I want to tell you first some, what I'm going to call "secrets" that may surprise you about learning languages , and then I'm going to explain how those secrets relate to using  our guides.
 
To understand how to use ESLPod lessons the most effective way. 

You have to understand at least one big thing about language learning ,and once you understand this big thing, you'll understand the rest what I'm going to  tell you about our Learning Guides.

Okay,so here's the one big important idea .

To pick up - or to , what we would  say "acquire" - a language, to really know a language, you have to understand the language.

To pick up a language,all you really need to do is understand the language you are listening to or reading.

If you can't understand it ,you can't learn it - or we would say,you can't "acquire" it.

Now ,You may be thinking to youself ,"well, that's obvious, Jeff.Of course, you can't acquire a language unless you understand it.

But it isn't really obvious at all.

In fact, I think that for many people, they spend their whole lives not understanding this basic idea.

Many people spend years trying to improve their English, and they do all sorts of things.

They study grammar ,they memorize vocabulary, they make lists, 

They make flash cards - little pieces of paper to try to memorize a word - they try to repeat everything they hear or everything they read ,they take tests, they give themselves quizzes,
they take examinations - they do all of these things thinking that these things will help them improve their English.

what I'm telling you today is that none of these things are necessary.

In fact, some of these things might actually make your English worse.

I know.It sounds crazy, but it's true.

The only thing you have to do to improve your English is find things you can mostly understand in English and then read or listen to them. 

If you find things you can read and listen to, things you can mostly understand,

your brain will take care of all you need in terms of improving your English.

You don't have to do anything else other then put yourself in a situation where you're listening to or reading English you can mostly understand.

Now, there's another way of saying this,

which is if you spend your time listening to or reading things you can't understand, you cannot understand, then you won't improve your English.

And this, in fact, is what many people do all the time.

They try to read books that are too hard for them,
