This episode is a story about me, introducing vocubulary you need to talk about yourself.

Let's get started.

Let me tell you a little about myself.

I was born and raised in Minnesota and I'm a native of the city of Saint Paul. 

I grew up there with my parents and my eight brothers and two sisters.

I'm the eleventh child, so you could say I'm the baby of the family,

but I swear I wasn't spoiled.

That's right, I'm part of a big family, probably the biggest family in the neighborhood,

perhaps the biggest family in the state!

I had a happy childhood, for the most part.

My father and mother didn't have a lot of money,

but because they both worked hard, we never felt deprived.

I wasn't much interested in sports, like my brothers were.

I enjoyed reading and listening to music while growing up.

I went to grade school near my house,

and then to high school about two miles away from our home.

After graduating from high school,

I went on to the university of Minnesota for my bacheolr's degree.

It took me a while to learn the ropes at the university,

but I finally graduated about six years later.

Better late than never, as my father used to say.

I then went to Mexico for a couple of years to teach English and to study Spanish.
