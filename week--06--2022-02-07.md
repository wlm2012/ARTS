These are new sentences that you haven't seen or heard before that use the words in context with other words you probably already know,

and that helps you get a better understanding of the word - that gives you another pass, another chance to see the words and to understand what they mean.

Some people ask me if you should look at the words before you listen to the episode or the lesson or before you read the lesson for the first time. 

I usually tell people no.

We know from the research, from scientific studies,

that trying to learn definations and then listen to something or read it isn't a very efficient use of time.

It's much better to read and listen, and then use the glossary as a review then it is to try to learn the word first and then go and listen.

Another part of the Learning Guide - at least our Daily English lesson guides - is Comprehension Questions. 

Now personally, I don't think you have to even look at the Comprehension Questions.

The reason we put them in these is some people like them.

Some people think it's kind of fun to see if you understood what you heard or listened to.

If you think it helps, then of course go ahead and look at them.
