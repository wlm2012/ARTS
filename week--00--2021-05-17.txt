Review：
Let me tell you a little about myself.
I was born and raised in Minnesota ,and I'm a native of the city of Saint Paul.
I grew up there with my parents,and my eight brothers and two sisters.
I'm the eleventh child ,so you could say I'm the baby of family,
but I swear I wasn't spoiled.
That's right, I'm the part of a big family ,probably the biggest of family in the  neighborhood,
perhaps ,the biggest family in the state.
I had a happy childhood, for the most part.
My father ans mother didn't have a lot of money,
but because they both worked hard , we never felt deprived.
I wasn's much interested in sports ,like my brothers were.
I enjoyed reading and listening to music while growing up.
I went to grade school near my house,
and then to high school about two miles away from our home.
After graduating from high school,
I went on to the University of Minnesota for my bachelor's degree.
