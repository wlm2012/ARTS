If you don't, or you don't really feel like answering questions, 

then I think it's okay to "skip" (skip) the questions.

"To skip" means not to do something.

So only do those if they help you.

Whether you answer them or not, the next thing you will find,

in our Daily English Learning Guides, is a section, at least in some of our more recent episodes,

called "What Else Does It Mean?"Not all of our episodes have this, but many of our Daily English episodes do.

"What Else Does It Mean?"personally is my favorite section.

In each episode we take two terms, or two words, 

from my dialogue and we explain other meanings that these words or terms have, either combined with additional words or by themselves,

that are different from the meanings that we talk about in the dialogue or the story.

English, like most languages, has many words that have more then one meaning.

This is the place where you can learn some of those additional meanings that we don't talk about in the lesson.

Another part of our Daily English Learning Guide is what we call our "Cultural Note".

We don't always have time to talk about every topic that is related to the main topics in our Daily English lessons, our ESL Podcast lessons - what we used to call "ESL Podcast" lessons.

So, the Learning Guide inculdes some additional cultural topic that is related to our dialogue or story for that day.

For example, the dialogue might be about taking a trip to Hawaii.

The cultural note would be some additional information about the history of the state of Hawaii, or perhaps a famous person who is from Hawaii.

For our Cultural English lessons, we have a similar kind of cultural note,

but we call it "What insiders know". 

An "insider" (insiders) is a person who knows about information because he has a lot of experience or he has lived in a certain place for a long time.
