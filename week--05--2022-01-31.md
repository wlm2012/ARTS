We used to call these "ESL Podcasts."These are our dialogue or regular episodes.

In these lessons, we read a dialogue or a story slowly.

We read it slowly so you can understand it, because remember - if you can't understand it, you can't learn it, you can't acquire it.

The next thing we do is we talk about the words in the dialogue so you can understand everything that we said, and at the end of the lesson,

we then give you the dialogue or story at a normal speed so you can hear what it sounds like in regular English, at least spoken by native speakers.

The other kind of lesson we have is our "Cultural English" lessons.

We uesd to call there our "English Cafés."

This is where we take one or two interesting cultural topics related to The United States somehow and talk about what it is and what it means.

This is our way of teaching new vocabulary as well as talking about American history and culture.

We also answer questions on our Cultural English,

or what we used to call our "English Cafés."we take questions from you, our listeners, and we answer them.

It's just like if you know someone who speaks English and you have a question about it, about some word,

you will go to that person and ask the person to explain it to you.

That's what we do on our cultural English lessons.

The Learning Guides for these two lessons are pretty similar.

There are some small differences.

Both of the Learning Guides have what we call our "Glossary" (glossary).

The Learning Guides start with a list of definitions of the main words or main terms that we use in that lesson.

These definitions are usually a little different from the ones I say on the audio,

so if you listen to the audio and then read the Learning Guide,

you may see a slightly different version of the defination, but it's the same thing, the same idea.

I suggest that you look at these definations quickly.

Remember that you usually have to see a word more than once to really understand it, and if you listen to the audios and then read the Learning Guide,

this gives you what we would call a "second pass" (pass), a second chance to see the word and the defination.

Now here's something I do not recommend you do, I don't suggest you do.

Don't go and create flash cards or write these words down on a piece of paper and then write the defination and then write a translation and then try to memorize these as though you were still back in school and the teacher was going to give you a test.

Here's some important news: I'm not going to give you a test.

I'm not going to call you up and ask you to tell me the meanings of those words.

In fact, trying to memorize words one by one is one of the slowest ways to improve your English.

If you want to take a long time to improve your English,

then I recommend you try to memorize words one by one.

There are more than 10,000 words that you need to acquire or pick up in order to read English fluently and listen to English fluently.
