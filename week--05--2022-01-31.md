We used to call these "ESL Podcasts."These are our dialogue or regular episodes.

In these lessons, we read a dialogue or a story slowly.

We read it slowly so you can understand it, because remember - if you can't understand it, you can't learn it, you can't acquire it.

The next thing we do is we talk about the words in the dialogue so you can understand everything that we said, and at the end of the lesson,

we then give you the dialogue or story at a normal speed so you can hear what it sounds like in regular English, at least spoken by native speakers.

The other kind of lesson we have is our "Cultural English" lessons.

We uesd to call there our "English Cafés."

This is where we take one or two interesting cultural topics related to The United States somehow and talk about what it is and what it means.

This is our way of teaching new vocabulary as well as talking about American history and culture.

We also answer questions on our Cultural English,

or what we used to call our "English Cafés."we take questions from you, our listeners, and we answer them.

It's just like if you know someone who speaks English and you have a question about it, about some word,

you will go to that person and ask the person to explain it to you.

That's what we do on our cultural English lessons.

The Learning Guides for these two lessons are pretty similar.

There are some small differences.

Both of the Learning Guides have what we call our "Glossary" (glossary).

The Learning Guides start with a list of definitions of the main words or main terms that we use in that lesson.

These definitions are usually a little different from the ones I say on the audio,

so if you listen to the audio and then read the Learning Guide,

you may see a slightly different version of the defination, but it's the same thing, the same idea.
