We used to call these "ESL Podcasts."These are our dialogue or regular episodes.

In these lessons, we read a dialogue or a story slowly.

We read it slowly so you can understand it, because remember - if you can't understand it, you can't learn it, you can't acquire it.

The next thing we do is we talk about the words in the dialogue so you can understand everything that we said, and at the end of the lesson,

we then give you the dialogue or story at a normal speed so you can hear what it sounds like in regular English, at least spoken by native speakers.

The other kind of lesson we have is our "Cultural English" lessons.
